[📌 Primary Development Roadmap](https://tinyurl.com/primary-board)

Primary is currently on the works to bring its warm palette to other apps!

---

A combination of Bauhaus, Scandinavian and yellowing magazine pages as palette inspiration—Primary is a theme for people looking for a certain nostalgic warmness.

It is toppled with functional pop of red blue yellow colors. The perfect mix of loud and reserved.

Playful, reminiscing, productive.

Available in both Light and Dark modes. Relax and have fun while you read your emails!

## 🔐 Permissions & Security

Primary for Thunderbird under the hood works more like an extension than a theme.

Permissions requested are messagesRead, messagesModify, compose, storage, tabs, and other experimental APIs. I understand that this may seem a lot and may worry some users but I guarantee you that I am only accessing components for the purposes of fulfilling Primary's design language. Though, it is at your discretion to continue installing the extension.

If you see a parts of code that may be posed a security-threat let me know by posting an issue or if you can I'd appreciate a pull request!

I do not make money selling your data and never plan to do so.

Thank you for understanding! 🙏

## 📥 Complete Guide to Installing Primary for Thunderbird

Due to some restrictions or unfound solutions for implementing certain design queues for the theme, there are extra steps needed to complete the Primary experience. Here's the full guide:

1. Start by setting your Thunderbird theme to default.
    - If you plan to use Primary Light Mode, install Thunderbird's Default Light Theme.
    - If you plan to use Primary Dark Mode, install Thunderbird's Default Dark Theme.
    - *Do not install the System Auto Default Theme. Primary breaks with that option, sorry!*
2. Next, install Primary via the Thunderbird Add-Ons store.
3. Next, open Settings by pressing the gear icon on the Left Toolbar.
4. Under General → Language and Appearance → press the **Colors** button.
    - If you're using Primary Light Mode:
        1. Set your Text Color to an RGB of `47, 32, 12` respectively.
        2. Set your Background Color to an RGB of `250, 248, 245` respectively.
        3. Set *"Override the colors specificed by the content with my selections above:"* to **Never**.
        4. To confirm changes, press OK.
    - If you're using Primary Dark Mode:
        1. Set your Text Color to an RGB of `n` respectively.
        2. Set your Background Color to an RGB of `n` respectively.
        3. Set *"Override the colors specificed by the content with my selections above:"* to **Never**.
        4. To confirm changes, press OK.
5. **(OPTIONAL)** If you'd like to use the font that Primary uses for its interface for your messages and composer, follow these steps:
    1. Download and install the [Inter](https://github.com/rsms/inter/releases/download/v3.19/Inter-3.19.zip) font (Pressing the link automatically downloads the `.zip` file from the official Inter Github Release).
    2. Once installed, open Settings by pressing the gear icon on the Left Toolbar.
    3. Under General → Language & Appearance → press the **Advanced** button.
    4. Set your Sans-serif font to **Inter**.
    5. Set your Monospace font to **Inter**.
    6. Uncheck *"Use fixed width font for plain text messages"*.
