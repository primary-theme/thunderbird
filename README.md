[📌 Primary Development Roadmap](https://tinyurl.com/primary-board)

Primary is currently on the works to bring its warm palette to other apps!

---

A combination of Bauhaus, Scandinavian and yellowing magazine pages as palette inspiration—Primary is a theme for people looking for a certain nostalgic warmness.

It is toppled with functional pop of red blue yellow colors. The perfect mix of loud and reserved.

Playful, reminiscing, productive.

Available in both Light and Dark modes. Relax and have fun while you read and write your emails!

## 🌈 Overview

This add-on fully customizes the Thunderbird app, unlike the standard theme. It sets a new interface design (altering the text and background colors, fonts, spacing, adding shadows, etc.) to Thunderbird features. This allows you to read and compose mails or news messages while enjoying the warmth of the Primary Theme. It includes design for the following:

- Inbox 
- Message (Only available in **Plain Text** and **Simple HTML** Views)
- Composer
- Address Book (Coming Soon)
- Calendar including Today Pane
- Tasks (Not Fully Tested)
- Chat (Not Fully Tested)
- Notification and Modals (Coming Soon)

See [Key Features](https://github.com/primary-theme/thunderbird#-key-features) for full details.

The Primary Theme add-on requests persmissions for messagesRead, messagesModify, compose, storage, tabs, and other experimental APIs. These permissions are only used to style Thunderbird’s interface; i.e. changing colors, fonts, spacing, adding shadows, etc. No data is collected and/or transferred elsewhere. It also doesn’t communicate with any external service; so everything is stored locally on your machine.

## 🔐 Permissions & Security

Primary for Thunderbird under the hood works more like an extension than a theme.

Permissions requested are messagesRead, messagesModify, compose, storage, tabs, and other experimental APIs. These permissions are only used to style Thunderbird’s interface; i.e. changing colors, fonts, spacing, adding shadows, etc. No data is collected and/or transferred elsewhere. It also doesn’t communicate with any external service; so everything is stored locally on your machine.

Be reminded though, that it is still at your discretion to continue installing the extension. If you see parts of the code that may be a security threat, let me know by posting an issue or if you can, I’d appreciate a pull request!

## 📥 Complete Guide to Install Primary for Thunderbird

Due to some restrictions or unfound solutions in implementing some parts of the design, there are extra steps needed to complete the Primary experience. Here's the full guide:

1. Start by setting your Thunderbird theme to default. To do this, go to the Settings by pressing the cog on the left vertical toolbar. If you aren't seeing this your left toolbar might be collapsed, so open it by pressing the arrow on the leftmost part of the bottom status bar. Once you've opened the Settings tab, press **Add-ons and Themes** which should take you to another tab. In the **Add-ons and Themes** tab, press **Themes**.
    - If you plan to use Primary in Light Mode, install Thunderbird's Default Light Theme.
    - If you plan to use Primary in Dark Mode, install Thunderbird's Default Dark Theme.
    - *Do not install the System Auto Default Theme. Primary breaks with that option, sorry!*
2. Next, install Primary via the Thunderbird Add-Ons store.
3. **(OPTIONAL, BUT NECESSARY TO COMPLETE THE EXPERIENCE)** If you'd like to use the font that Primary uses for its interface for your messages and composer, follow these steps:
    1. Download and install the [Inter](https://github.com/rsms/inter/releases/download/v3.19/Inter-3.19.zip) font (Pressing the link automatically downloads the `.zip` file from the official Inter Github Release).
    2. Once installed, open Settings by pressing the gear icon on the Left Toolbar.
    3. Under General → Language & Appearance → press the **Advanced** button.
    4. Set your Sans-serif font to **Inter**.
    5. Set your Monospace font to **Inter**.
    6. Uncheck *"Use fixed width font for plain text messages"*.
